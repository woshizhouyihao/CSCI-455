DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:
AnagramDictionary.java
Using HashPap to store sorted anagram token and arraylist as value to store all words appeared in dictionary with same token

WordFinder.java
Method printResult() help take in the input from user. The method will sort the input first by letters in order to sychronize first and then using getAnagramsOf(string s) method to get all possible words. To print out the result, using arraylist to help sort HashMap and using alphabetical order as tie breaker for those with same score.
initAnagramDict() to catch all possible exceptions when initialize the anagram dictionary

Rack.java
Using HashMap to preprocess the input, store letters with frequency and plug in the default method to get result
