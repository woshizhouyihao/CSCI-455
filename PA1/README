ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. code by course staff and code from textbook

2. 2 heads: 1/4, 2 tails: 1/4, 1 head and tail: 1/2. It is different becasue in total there are two possible chances for 1 head and tail out of 4.

3. 1500 trials needed roughly

4. 40000000 is the largest value tried and worked correctly and 50000000 makes it overflow.
